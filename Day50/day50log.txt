What are vector stores
 A vectore storre is system desinged to store and retrieve data represented as numerical vectors.

 Key features:-
 1.Storage 
    Ensures that vectors and their associated metadata are reatined, whether in memory for quick lookups
    or on disk durability and large scale use.

2. Similarity search
    Helps retrieve the vectors most similar to a query vector.

3.Indexing
    Provides a data structure or method that enables fast similarity serachson high dimensional vectors 

4.CRUD Operations
    Manage the lifecycle of data -adding new vectors ,reading them, updating existing ,removing outdated vectors


Use cases
    1. Semantic search
    2.RAG
    3.Recommonder systems
    4.Images/Multimedia search


Vector store vs Vector Database

    vector
        ->Typically refers to a lightweight library or service that focuses on storing vectors (embeddings) 
        and performing similarity search.
        ->May not include many traditional database features like transaction , rich query languages or role - based control
        -> Ideal for prototyping ,smaller applications
        -> Example:-
            FAISS(where you store vectors and can query them by similarity, but you handle persistence and scaling separately)
        
        Vector Database
            -> A full fledged database sysetm designed to store and query vectors
            -> offfers additional "database-like" features
                    Distributed architecture for horizontal scaling
                    durability and persistance 
                    Metadata handlign (schemas, filters)
                    Potential for ACID or near ACID guarantees
                    Authentication /authorization and more advanced security
                ->Geared for production environments with significiant scaling, large datasets 
                -> Examples: milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate,pinecone
            
    A vector database is effectively a vector store with extra database features (eg clustering ,scaling , 
    security, metadata filetering and durability)

    Vector stores in langchain
        supported stores:
            langchain integrates with multiple vector stores (FAISS,Pinecone, chroma, Qdrant,weaviate) giving you 
            flexibility in scale , features , and deployment
        Common interface:
            A uniform Vector store API lets you swap out one backend for another 
        Meta data handling 
            Most vector stores in langchain allow you to attach metadata to each document, enabling filter based retrieval.

    Chroma

        chroma is a lightweight , open -source vector database that is especially friendly for local development and small - to medium -scale production needs.
