 what is cloud computing?
    Cloud computing means using the internet to access computers, storage, and services instead of 
    buying and maintaining your own. So instead of buying a big server, you rent it from companies like AWS
     (Amazon Web Services). You can store files, run websites, or use databases — all online — and only pay for what you use, 
     like electricity.

What is Amazon Web Servies?
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a platform by Amazon that lets you use powerful tools like servers, storage, databases,
     and more — all through the internet. Instead of buying expensive hardware, you can rent what you need from AWS and 
     only pay for what you use. It helps people and companies build websites, apps, store files, or run software without needin
     g their own computers or data centers.

Global infrastructure of AWS.
    The global infrastructure of AWS includes Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), and Edge Locations.
    Regions are places around the world (like Mumbai or Tokyo) where AWS has data centers.
    Each Region has AZs, which are separate data centers that keep your apps running even if one fails.
    Edge Locations are used to deliver content faster to users, like for websites or videos.


Networking on AWS
        Networking on AWS is how different resources (like servers, databases) talk to each other securely inside the cloud.

    Key Parts (in simple terms):
        VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Your own private network in AWS where you place servers, databases, etc.
        Subnets: Smaller sections inside a VPC (public or private).
        Security Groups: Act like firewalls — control what traffic is allowed in or out.
        Route Tables: Decide how data moves inside your VPC.
        Internet Gateway: Lets your VPC connect to the internet.
        NAT Gateway: Lets private servers access the internet without being exposed.

Compute in the Cloud 
    Compute in the cloud means using virtual computers (instead of physical ones) to run applications, websites, or code.

    Main AWS Compute Services:
        EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Rent virtual machines (like a remote computer).
        Lambda: Run your code without managing any server — just upload code and it runs.
        Elastic Beanstalk: Easily deploy apps — AWS handles the setup.
        ECS / EKS: Run and manage containers (like Docker).


Account Security in AWS?
    Account security in AWS means protecting your AWS account from unauthorized access and misuse. It focuses on who can log in and what they can do.

 Key Account Security Practices:
    Use a Strong Root Account Password
    – The root user has full control. Use a strong, unique password.
    Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
    – Adds a second step (like a phone code) to log in. Protects against stolen passwords.
    Create IAM Users (don’t use root for daily tasks)
    – Give individual users their own login and permissions.
    Use IAM Roles and Policies
    – Grant only the minimum permissions needed (called least privilege).
    Monitor with CloudTrail
    – Tracks account activity (who did what, when).
    Set up Billing Alerts
    – Get notified if your account spends more than expected (helps detect hacking).

Storage and Database in AWS
Storage in AWS
    S3 (Simple Storage Service):
        Store any kind of files like photos, videos, backups. It’s super scalable and durable.
    EBS (Elastic Block Store):
        Like a hard drive you attach to a virtual server (EC2). Used for fast, block-level storage.
    Glacier:
        Very cheap storage for files you don’t need to access often — good for backups or archives.

 Databases in AWS
    RDS (Relational Database Service):
        Managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server — AWS handles backups and maintenance.
    DynamoDB:
        A fast, fully managed NoSQL database for apps needing quick, scalable access.
    Aurora:
        AWS’s own high-performance relational database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Monitoring and Analysis
    Monitoring in AWS:
        AWS helps you keep an eye on your resources (like servers, databases, apps) to make sure everything is running smoothly.

        CloudWatch:
        Tracks performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage), logs, and can send alerts if something goes wrong.

        CloudTrail:
        Records all the actions people and services do in your AWS account for security and auditing.

    Analysis in AWS:
    You can analyze logs and data to understand usage, troubleshoot issues, or improve your system.

        AWS Config:
        Keeps track of changes to your AWS resources and checks if they follow rules you set.

        AWS Trusted Advisor:
        Gives recommendations to optimize security, cost, performance, and fault tolerance.
