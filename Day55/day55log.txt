LSPP Day 55

Today i learned:-

AL Agents

An AI agent is a intelligent system that receives a high - level goal from a user,
 and autonomously plans, decides, and executes a sequence of actions by using external tools, 
 APIs or knowledge sources - all while maintaining context, reasoning over multiple steps, adapting to
  new information, and optimizing for the intended outcome.

Characteristics
    Goal driven
    Autonomous planning
    Tool using 
    Context-aware
    Adaptive

    ReAct

    ReAct is s design pattern used in ai agents that stands for reasoning + Acting .
     it allows a language model to interleave internal reasoning with external actions in a structured , multi step process.
    Instead of generating an answer in one go, the model thinks step by step, deciding what i needs to do next and optionally 
    calling tools (APIs, calculators, web search) to help it

    ReAct is useful for:
        Multi step problem
        Tool augmented tasks (web search, database lookup etc)
        Making the agents reasoning transparent and auditable

    ReAct is all about ( Thought, Action, Observation ) loop.

    Agent & Agent Executor

    Agent Executor orchestrates the entire loop.
    1.Sends inputs and previous message 
    2.Gets the next action from agents
    3.Executes that tool with provided input
    4.Adds the tool's observation back into the history
    5.Loops again with updated history until the agent says Final answer.

    Flow of Ai agent

        Agent Executor->Receive User Query
        ->Pass user query+ agents scratap to agent
        -> Agent response
                agent action
                agent Finish
                    Return final output
