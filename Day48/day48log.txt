LSPP Day 48

Today i Learned:-

what is RAG
RAG is technique that combines information retrieval with language genration, 
where a model retrieves relevant couments from a knowledge bse and then uses them as 
context to generate accourate and grounded responses.

Benefits of using RAG 
 1.Use of up to date information
 2.Better privacy
 3.No limit of document size


 Components of RAG
    -> Document Loader
    -> Text Splitters
    ->Vector Databases
    -> Retrievers

    Document Loader
        Document loader are components in langchain used to load data
         from various sources into a Standardized format (usually as Document objects), 
         which can then be used for chunking embedding, retrieval and generation. 

    Most used document loader
        -> Text loader
        -> pyPDF loader
        -> webBaseloader
        -> CSVLoader

    Text loader

    textLoader is a somple and commonly used document loader in langchain that reads plain text files anc converts them into langchain document objects.only works with txt files

    All the document loader output the list of document

PyPDFLoader
 
per page one document or a list
 PyPDFLoader is a document loader in langchain used to load content from pdf files and convert each page into a document object.
not great of pdf having other thing than txt

Directory loader

directory loader is a document loader that lets you load multiple documents from a directory of files.

lazy load
lazy loading (loads on demand)
returns a generator of document objects
documents are not all loaded at once. they're fetched one at a time as needed. 
best when 
    working will large files


WebBase loader

Webbase loader is a document loader in langchain used to load and extract text content from web pages 

CSVLoader

csvloader is a document loader used to load csv files into langchain documents objects one per row, by default.
