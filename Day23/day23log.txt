LSPP Day 23 

 Today i learned:-
 Pytorch Bird eye view
    pytorch is open source deep learning library using which we can create very powerful neural network.Developed by Facebook(Meta)
    Origin of pytorch 
        initial Torch (Scitific computing framework) which was created for tensor based operation to over come the draw Torch had pyTorch came into existence

PyTorch first version was released in 2017
    It was python compatable
    it was dynamic computation graph    
        Visual way of representing math operations
            All the ML library stored the sub problem in term of graph which is known as computation graph
    ONNX-> open neural network exchange
    Model quantization -> compressed the model to less size than original size
    Keras-> high level API for tensorflow . using keras we can manipulated the tensorflow
    Pytorch Lighting-> High level API for pytorch
    hugging face transformer-> it was written in pytorch

Pytorch Version 2.0 
    Optimized on latency and throughput

Pytorch or Tensorflow
    ->Pytorch works in python.it is more easyf
    ->TensorFlow supports mulitple languages
    ->tensorFlow wins on the context of deployment,industry,production

Core Pytorch modules
    torch 
    torch.autograd-> for automatic differentiations
    torch.nn-> main neural network library
    torch.optim-> optimization library
    torch.utils.data-> load datasets
    torch.jit-> using for torch script
    torch.distruted-> distributed training train on multi gpu env
    torch.cuda-> special nvida gpu
    torch.backends->helps you select different types of backends
    torch.multiprocessing -> used for parallel processing
    torch.quantization-> compresses the model
    torch.onnx-> create onnx compatible model generation

    Who uses pytorch 
        Facebook -> Facebook app, insta app, meta ai research
        Microsoft -> Azure machine learning
        Tesla   -> Autopilot full written in pytorch
        OpenAI -> Gpt series uses pytorch
        Uber -> they has create there own pytorch wrapper called pyro.
