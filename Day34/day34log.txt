Today i learned:-

What is RNN?
Recurrent Neural Network
RNN is a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data by remembering past information.

Key Features:
    Has a memory of previous inputs.
    Great for time series, text, speech, and other sequential data.
    Processes input one step at a time, keeping context.

Common Use Cases:
    Language modeling
    Text generation
    Sentiment analysis
    Stock price prediction

RNN is type of neural network desinged for processing sequential data. Unlike traditional feeedforward networks. which process inputs independently. RNN maintain a memory of previous inputs by using loops in their architecture. 
The makes them well suited for task where context and order matter, such as time series forecasting speech recongnition and text generation. 

How does it works? 
It all works on the basis of timestep like every step thing happen like first timestep it take 1 input converts into in number and then another step another another input include with the previous output.
eg
How RNN Works (Simplified):
Sequence Input
Input comes in a sequence, like a sentence:
["I", "love", "AI"]

Timestep 1
Take the first word → convert to number/vector (embedding)
Feed it into the RNN

RNN gives an output and a hidden state (memory)
→ This hidden state carries info to the next step

Timestep 2
Take the second word
Combine it with the previous hidden state
Output + new hidden state generated

Timestep 3

Repeat the same: input + memory = output + updated memory
