 What is Optuna?
    Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework in Python.

What it does:
    Helps you find the best hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, etc.)
    Uses smart algorithms (like TPE, Bayesian optimization) to explore parameter space efficiently.
    Supports early stopping, parallel optimization, and visualizations.


Bayesian Search
    Bayesian Search is a smart method to optimize hyperparameters by building a probabilistic model of the objective function and using it to choose the most promising hyperparameters to try next.

Key Idea:
    Instead of randomly guessing, it learns from past trials to pick better future values.

In Hyperparameter Tuning:
    You define a search space (e.g., learning rate from 0.001 to 0.1)
    Bayesian optimization predicts which values are likely to give good results.

It balances:
Exploration (trying new things)
Exploitation (refining what works)

Key Terms  in Optuna
1.Study
    (overall experiment for where we are trying to extract be hype parameter value)
2.Trail

3.Trial parameters
4.Objective Function
    (we send value of hypeparameter and in return we get accuracy value)
5.sampler

Optuna offers flexibility we can use Bayein search also or else Random Search only can be done

Optuna offers another feature that is visualization.

1.optimization history plot 
    (trial no vs accuracy value)
2.Parallel Corrdinate plot
        (used in MLFlows)
            helps you understand relationship between accuracy, max_depth , n_estimator
3.slices plot
   ( max_depth  or n_estimator vs objective value)
4.contour plot
    region identification for highest accuracry( more blue meaning more accuracy)
5.Importances plot 
    tell which hyperparameter are more important.

Features Define by run:-
    Help to create dynamic search space.
    (dfferent model same hyperparameter tuning)

Optuna has very great integration with sklearn,keras,pytorch,mlflow
