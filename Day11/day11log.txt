LSPP Day 11
Part 2 of  "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" 
By:-Isa Fulford of OpenAi and Andrew Ng of Deeplearning.ai

I learned today the followings :-
Iterative Prompt Development
     It kinda works in circle 
        1.Idea
        2.Implementation
        3.Experimental result
        4.Error Analysis

prompt Guidelines
    1.Be celar and specific
    2.Analyze why result does not give desired output 
    3.Refine the idea and the prompt
    4.Repeat

Guide it proper using what specifically do you what from the answer like you could be wanting only TL;DR then mention it proper that you only need the tl;dr of the following

LLM uses tokenizer to interpret text available to them 

Prompt -> analyze -> clarify->prompt -> analyze->clarify->prompt until you get what you what.

found out 
    "from IPython.display import display, HTML
    display(HTML(response)) "

    This is used to display response or data in html format rather than raw format. 

    other available from ipython.display are from IPython.display import Image, Markdown, Latex, Audio, JSON

# Display an image
display(Image(url="https://example.com/image.png"))

# Show markdown
display(Markdown("**Bold Text**"))

# Show LaTeX
display(Latex(r"\frac{a}{b}"))

# Play audio
display(Audio("audio.mp3"))

# Show JSON
display(JSON({'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}))


3rd video of course 
    summarize

    There the LLM could be used in the way like if the ecommerce has thousand of review we could use summarize the product sight

using loops could go step by step

4th video of course
inferring
machine learning algorithm uses inferring without training model without need huge dataset.
Inferring in prompting is all about  asking a language model  to draw conclusions, make guesses, or understand meaning from a given piece of text â€” even if that meaning isn't directly stated. It's a way of getting the model to "read between the lines.
