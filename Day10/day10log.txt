LSPP Day 10

Today i enrolled in the course  "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" 
By:-Isa Fulford of OpenAi and Andrew Ng of Deeplearning.ai
"https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/dfbds/introduction"

I learned today the followings :-
    There are two types of Large Languages models(LLMs)
        =>Base LLM
                It was created to predict the next word based on text training data. 
                 (fully trained of data available in internet)
        =>Instruction Tuned LLM
                Instruction tuned llm has been tune to follow pure instruction
                found out that instruction tuned llm has its base as Base LLM and on top of that it is trained by providing inputs and outputs and fine tune on the basis of good attempts
            It is further fined using 
                RLHF:Reinforcement learning with human feedback

                Instruction tuned is set to be Helpful, Honest and Harmless

The course teaches based on the Instruction tuned LLM 
    Principle and tactis for
        principle 
            => Write clear and specific instruction 
            => Give Model time to think


            First tactics 1: use delimiters(""", tag,---,...)=> create the perfect separation

delimiter helps out with prompt injection that is like conflicting instructions to that should not be followed

Tactic 2:Ask for structured output(json, or html)
Tactic 3: Check whether conditions are satisfied and check assumptions required to do the task

Tactic 4:Few -shot prompting
            give an example and on the basis of that let it know to performance 

    =>Give model time to think 
        -> tactic 1:-> tell it to do step by step method 
        -> tactic 2:->instruct the model to work out its own solution do reasonings

        Model limitations while developing application point to be noted.
