LSPP Day 44

Today i learned:-

In Langchain structured output refers tot he practice of having language models 
return responses in a well - defined data format (for example , JSON), rather than
 free -form text. This makes the model output easier to parse and work with programmatically. 

[Prompt]= can you create one day travel itinerary for paris?
Free it returns a text it is unstructured output

structured:-JSON enforced output 

Why do we need structured output?
    Data Extraction
    API building 
    Agents

Agents needs structured output

 LLMs
    that can 
        => with_structured output
    that can't 
        => output parser
    
    Before invoke
            state with_structured_output
                and data format
            
        

specifying data format with 
    Typed Dict
        Typed Dict is a way to define a dcitionary in python where you specific what keys and values should exist, it helps ensure that your dictionary follows a specific structure.

        why use typed Dict?
            -> It telss python what keys are required and waht types of values they should have. 
            -> it does not validate data at runtime( it helps with type hints for better coding) 

        Pydantic 
            pydantic is a data validation and data parsing library for python. It ensures that the data you work with is correct, structured , and type -safe

    Json

    When to used what
        use typedDict if :
             need type hints
             don't need validation
            trust the LLM
        use Pydantic if:
            data validation
            default values
            automatic type conversion
        JSON  Schema
            don't want python library
            validation but don't need python objects
                standard json format
