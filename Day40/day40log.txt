LSPP Day 40

Today i learned:-

Langchain components
    1.Models
    2.Prompts
    3.Chains
    4.Memory
    5.Indexed
    6.Agents

=>Models 
    In langchain "models' are the core interfaces through which you interact with Ai models. 
    Give you standarized way to talk with all the different company api such as 
    claude, gemini, open ai

    in langchain there are two types of model 
       1. language model
            input text -> output text (LLMs)
        2.Embedding model
            Text input -> vector as output (semantic search)
            
What is Semantic Search?
    Semantic search is a search technique that understands the meaning or context behind your query — not just the exact words.

 How It Works:
            Instead of matching keywords (like traditional search), it:
            Converts the query and documents into embeddings (vectors)
            Measures semantic similarity (how close the meanings are)
            Returns results that are contextually relevant, even if the exact words don’t match

=>Prompts
    1.Dynamic
    2.Role based prompts
    3.Few shot prompting
     
=>Chains
    Chains is the component of langchain that is just to build pipelines . 

    pipelines
            A pipeline is a step-by-step process where data flows through multiple stages, with each stage performing a specific task.while going to different stage you don't have to feed it output.

            types
                -> parallel chains(parallel processing)
        
                ->Conditional chains(conditional eg :- if feedback good just reply thank you but if reply bad create the experience question)

=>indexes
    indexes connected your application to external knowledge -such as PDFs websites or databases.
    4 things
        Document loader
        Text splitter
        Vector store
        Retriever

=>Memory
        LLMs API calls are stateless
                Memory available in langchain
                    ConversationalBufferMemory
                    ConversationBufferWindowMemory
                    Summarizer Based Memory
                    Custom Memory
    =>Agents
        Ai agents = chatbot with super power
            has 
                _Reasoning capablities
                _Acces to tool
