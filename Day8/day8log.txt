LSPP Day 8

I started with numpy for today a doing image manipulation using matplotlib and numpy
Point to note:-
    numpy is the based of various major library like pytorch and pandas
    np.save("filename", value(array))=> this generate a file and save it in the same directory
    np.load("filename")=> this load the file into the program

   plt.subplot(121)  => Same as plt.subplot(1, 2, 1) (rows,cols, index) 
    =>subplot is used to display multiple plots (charts/graphs) in a single figure window, arranged in a grid layout.
    
    plt.imshow()=>
                  plt.imshow() is a Matplotlib function used to display images or 2D arrays as a visual grid of pixels (like heatmaps or actual image files).
     

     Used Pillow module and learned many methods of pillow such as 
            Image.open(path)=> Opens an image file from some dir
            img.save("file.jpg")=> Saves the image  into the same dir               
            img.show()=>Displays image in default viewer 
            img.close()=>Closes the image file            

        img.size((w,h))=> this resize image into different size
        img.crop((top,button,left,right))=> cuts or crop the image 
        img.rotate(angle)=> rotate the image by certain angle
        img.transpose(method)=> flips image of what ever is asked to do 
            eg:-# Flip horizontally
                        img.transpose(Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT)    

        img.convert()=> the converts image to following "L" for grayscale "RGB" for colored and "RGBA" colored with opacity


        Image filter were also available
            img.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) yesma .show() yetai lagawona pani milxaa haii taa sathi
            img.filter(ImageFilter.CONTOUR)
            img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN)


            filters = [
                ImageFilter.BLUR,
                ImageFilter.CONTOUR,
                ImageFilter.DETAIL,
                ImageFilter.EDGE_ENHANCE,
                ImageFilter.EMBOSS,
                ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES,
                ImageFilter.SHARPEN,
                ImageFilter.SMOOTH
            ]

            These are all the available filter in pill

            and importantly display() is used to display in the console onlyy
