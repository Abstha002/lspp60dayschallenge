LSPP Day 57

Today i learned:-

Agentic AI is a type of AI that can take up a task or goal 
from a user then work toward completing it on its own , with minimal human guidance.
It plans , takes action, adapts to changes, and seeks help only when necessary

Key Characteristics
    Autonomous
    Goal Oriented 
    Planning 
    Reasoning
    Adaptability
    Context Awareness

Autonomy
    Autonomy refers to the Ai system's ability to make decisions and take 
    actions on its own to achieve a given goal, without needing step by step 
    human instructions

    1. Our AI recruiter is autonomous
    2.It's proactive
    3.Auonomy in mulitple facets
    4.Autonomy can be controlled
    5. Autonomy can be dangerous

Goal Oriented 
    Being goal oriented means that the ai system operates with a persistent 
    objective in mind and continously directs its actions to achieve that objective , 
    rather than just responding to isolated prompts 
    1. Goals acts as a compass for autonomy
    2.Goals can come with constraints
    3. Goals are stored in core memory
    4.Goals can be altered

Planning
    Planning is the agent's ability to break down a high - level down a high level 
    goal into a structured sequence of  actions or subgoals and decide the best path to 
    achieve the desired outcome
    Step 1: Generating multiple candidate plans
    Step 2:Evaluate each plan
    Step 3:Select the plan with the help of human

Reasoning
    Reasoing is the cognitive process through which an agentic ai system interprets 
    informations, draws conclusions , and make decisions - both while planning ahead and 
    while executing actio in real time .

    Reasoning During planning:
        1.Goad decomposition
        2.tool selection
        3.Resource esimation
    Reasoning during execution
        1.Decision making
        2.HITL handling 
        3.Error handling
    
    Adaptability
        Adaptability is the agent's to modify its plan.s strategies  or actions in
         response to unexpected conditions - all while staying aligned with the goal. 

        1. Failures 
        2.External feedbaack 
        3.Chaning goals 

    
    Context Awareness
        context awareness is the agent's ability to understand , retain and utilize
         relevant information from the ongoing task, past interactions , user perferences , 
         and environmental cues to make better decisions throughout a multi step process
        1.Type of context
        2.Context awareness is implemented through memory
        3.Short team memory
        4.Long term memory
