LSPP Day 41

Today i learned:_

what are models?
The model componenet in langchain is a crucial part of the framework, designed to faciliate interactions
 with various languages models and embedding models. 

it abstract the complexity of workign directly with different LLMs chat models and embedding models, providiing
 a uniform interface to communicate with them. This makes it easier to build application that rely on AI generated test,
  text embedding for similiarity search, and retirival augmented generation

Languages Models are AI systems designed to process generate and understand natural languages text 

Type so languages model
    1.LLMs(Generate purpose,no memory ) inherits from baseLLM
    2.Chat Models
        chat model is used to conversational chat.(chat messages a input and chat messages as output, has memory)
         inherits from BaseChatModel

    
    Open Source Models
        open source languages models are freely available Ai models that canb e downloaded modififed ,fine-tuned and
         deployed without restriction sfrom a central provider , unlike cloased source models such as OpenAi gpt-4 ,
          anthropic claude or google gemini open source models allow full control and customization

    HuggingFace:-
        hugging face is the large repository of open source Ai models

    Ways to use Open source model
        -> using HF inference api
        -> running locally
    
    Disadvantages
        High hardware Requirements
        Setup complexity
        lack of RLHF( less fine tuning)
        Limited multimodel abiliities (text, images ...)

    Steps involved in open source 
        -> Get on API Key or download locally
        -> then import chathuggingface, huggingfaceEndpoint 
        -> create object of huggind face endpoint object
            then create  set the 
                repo_id and others parameter(task..)
        -> invoke the model with prompt
        -> get result
