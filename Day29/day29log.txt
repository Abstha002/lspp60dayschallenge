Today i learned :-
What is ANN
    ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. 
    It consists of layers of interconnected neurons (nodes) that process input data to learn patterns and make predictions.

    Basic Structure:
    Input Layer – takes in the features
    Hidden Layers – process data using weights & activation functions
    Output Layer – gives the final prediction

create the simple ANN model and how do it works

this will have input layer ( hidden layer *2(128N, 64N),reLU()), output layer(10N),(softMax)

why softMax -> because it is multi class model

workFlow 
   -> Dataloader objects
    ->Training loops
   -> Evaluation


CrossEntropyLoss
CrossEntropyLoss is a loss function used for multi-class classification that measures the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the actual class label.

Difference between binary and crossEntropy
    BCE: "Is this email spam?" → 0 or 1
    CE: "What digit is this?" → one of 10 classes (0–9)
