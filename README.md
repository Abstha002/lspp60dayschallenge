# 60-Day Learning Challenge 2025 with LSPP

Welcome to my **60-Day Learning 2025 Challenge** repository! This project is part of the Leapfrog Student Partnership Program (LSPP) to master AI/ML, DevOps, AWS, Docker, and more, aiming for internships and community growth on X. Started on [Start Date, e.g., May 31, 2025], I’m documenting my journey day by day, building skills and sharing progress.

## About Me
- **Name**: Abhay Shrestha
- **Goal**: Land an internship in AI/ML or DevOps by enhancing technical skills and networking.
- **X Handle**: @abhay_shrestha
- **Contact**: [abhayshrestha18@gmail.com]

## Project Overview
This repository contains code, notes, and exercises from my 60-day learning plan, focusing on:
- **AI/ML**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Prompt Engineering (ChatGPT), etc.


Each day’s work is organized in a dedicated folder (e.g., `Day1`, `Day13`) with scripts, notebooks, and outputs.

## About the Challenge, Leapfrog, and LSPP
The **60-Day Learning 2025 Challenge** is a personal initiative to accelerate my growth in cutting-edge technologies, inspired by the Leapfrog Student Partnership Program (LSPP). LSPP, offered by Leapfrog, a leading technology company in Nepal, empowers students like me to gain practical skills, collaborate with a global community, and compete for top 60 recognition. Leapfrog is renowned for its innovative software solutions and commitment to nurturing talent, providing a platform to explore AI/ML, DevOps, AWS, and Docker—fields critical for modern tech careers. This challenge, spanning from May 31, 2025, to [End Date, e.g., July 29, 2025], is my journey to build a portfolio, network on X, and prepare for internships, all while contributing to the LSPP community under the guidance of @lftechnology.
