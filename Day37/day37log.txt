Today i Learned:-

    What is Cloud computing?
    Computing as utility
    ->Pay as you use
        points
            =>Access Services on demand
                You want networking you get networking on demand.
           => Avoid large upfront investments
            =>Provision computing resources as needed
            =>Pay only for what you use
        
        Instead of buying , owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers , you can access technology serives, such as computing power, storage  and databases on an as=needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services(AWS).

        What are cloud computing service models?
            1.SaaS(software as a service)
                    Eg:- Facebook , gmail
            2.Paas(platfrom as a service)
                    Think like if i want to deploy dot,net app then dot.net framework much be present there.

             3.Iaas(Infrastructure as a service)
                what you want(storage, cpu and others)

    What are deployment model?
       => Public cloud 
            when all public can use the cloud such kind of deployment model is public cloud(AWS,Azure,Google cloud)
       => Private cloud 
            cloud specifically made for us.
        => Hybrid Cloud    
                Mix of public and private

        Advantage of using cloud computing
            =>Avoid upfront expense
            =>Advantage of Variable expense
            =>Avoid running your own data centers
            =>Focus on your application and customer
            => Avoid focus on guessing infrastructure needs
            =>Rather scale out or scale in when needed
            =>Wanting and having resource may take weeks 
            => Minutes between wanting resources and having rescources
            =>Fast deployment of application / infrastructure world wide 
            => Take advantage of AWS Global infrastructure
