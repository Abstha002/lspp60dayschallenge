Lists and Dictionaries
    Day 3 would be fully focused on List and Dictionaries of the python program.
    Why Lists and Dictionaries matters?
        Reasons found are:-
        for list
            Store data like training examples, features, or predictions
            Easy to loop through and process in ML models
            Used to batch data for training neural networks
        for Dictionaries
            Store structured data, like model settings or word-to-index mappings.
            Help organize data clearly and make it easy to look things up.
    Key Notes:-
        List and array are similar but different List can store different data type but array stores only one Data type.
        Array are most used as from numpy.py module(Python library for fast and efficient numerical computations)

    From question 
        =>append() only works on list does works on dictionaries in dic.. DName[key]=value init
        =>max() and min() function works on both list and dictionaries
        => .items() gives you key and value from a dictionary.
        =>enumerate() gives you index and item from a list (or any iterable).
        ->Lambda function()
        syntax->lambda arguments: expression
            It's a small anonymous function (a function without a name).
            Usually used for short, simple functions.
            Can take any number of arguments but only one expression.
            The expressionâ€™s result is automatically returned.
            Eg->lamba x,y:x+y=>gives sum of x and y
        ->sorted() builtin function 
                syntax=>sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)
