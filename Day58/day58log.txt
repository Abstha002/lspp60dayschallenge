What is langgraph?
    LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain that lets you create stateful, multi-step AI workflows using graphs instead of simple linear chains.

 In Simple Words:
    LangGraph = LangChain + Graphs + Memory

    It allows you to define nodes (steps like calling an LLM or doing logic) and edges (how outputs move between steps), giving you more control and flexibility.

 Why use LangGraph?
    1.Loops (e.g., re-ask if answer is bad)
    2. Conditional logic (e.g., different steps for different inputs)
    3.Memory/state management
    4. Multi-agent workflows
    5.Better suited for complex, non-linear tasks


Difference between langchain and langgraph?
    LangChain
        A framework to build applications using language models.
        It is Stateless

    Feature	Description
         Structure	Mostly linear chains or sequential pipelines
        Easy to use	Good for simple prompts, chains, and tools
     Limited control	Doesn’t support loops or complex branching well
        Best for	Simple apps like chatbots, QA systems, and data pipelines

     LangGraph
        An extension of LangChain for stateful, graph-based workflows.
        It is Stateful 

    Feature	Description
         Graph structure	Nodes (steps) and edges (transitions) like a flowchart
        Supports loops	Yes — can repeat steps based on conditions
        Conditional logic	Dynamic path selection based on state/output
         Stateful memory	Keeps and updates memory between steps
         Multi-agent ready	Designed for complex, multi-agent workflows
         Best for	Advanced systems with memory, retry loops, and decision flows
