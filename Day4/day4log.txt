 Day 4 lspp
 Today i learned and used jupyter notebook and found its shortcut and usecase and other platform like juypter note book

 `Data Science and Web Development are distinct, but they complement each other and often 
 work together in real-world applications.`

 jyputer notebooks 
 what is jupyter notebook -> Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-based application that allows you to write and run code interactively, especially in Python. It’s very popular in data science, machine learning, data analysis, and education.
 what is jupyter labs-> it is just a refined version of jyputer notebook
 Ananconda distribution software gives us the benefit that not only juypter other software also comes with it.

 python utility -> pip  
 learned to create virtual environment in python why virtual environment 
    ->python3 -m venv venv (for mac)
        ->source venv/bin/activate 
        ->deactivate 
    why virtual env
        -> avoid conflicts(different version of package,system clean)

Here in juypter lab 
 This .ipynb extension in juypter stands for (interactive python nåotebook)
     in juypter we have Markdown => stands for note
                                        Code=> executable shell
        shorts cuts in juypter 
            Markdown
                # Main Heading 
                ## subheading
                ### small heading 

                --- ( This draws line)

                (shift + enter ) =>  executes and goes to new shell
                (ctrl + enter) => executes and stays in the same shell

                shell above (Key = A)  
                shell below(Key = B)  
                MarkdownKey = M)  
                shell code Key = Y)  
    
                using Esc arrows to go up and down
                 press  DD for deleting the codes


Google colab 
    => powered by google where numpy and other library are already installed
Kaggle 
    =>is another software that would be used for datasets 
    => kaggle also provides markdown and code(notebook)
