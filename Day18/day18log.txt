LSPP Day 18
Machine learning Development life cycle

1.Frame the Problem
    -> Define the boundaries of the problem.Research and analyze. Planning
        Every question much be answered in this phase.
2.Gathering the Data
    ->Different sources of data (api, database, ...) 
        Gathering required data and storing correct format
3.Data Preprocssing
    ->The gather data is messed so data preprocessing is need and it is done like in the way of removing duplicate, noise,outliers  , standarding the data
4.Exploratory data Analysis
    ->studing the relationship between input and output.
    we do the analysis like (mean, variance and all things)
5.Feature Engineering and selection
    ->creating new features
    ->selecting feature which is actually impactful
6.Model Training Evaulation and Seletion
    ->Try many different algorithms and deciding with is best.
7.Model Deployment
    ->Deploying ML model in server (binary file ma convert garera hunxa hai you chai)
8.Testing
    ->A/B testing(old/new)
9.Optimize
    ->Launch the model of scale 
         before the we do 
                (model back up, data backup, roll back automation,load balancing,retrainff)

Note:-
    Noise = random mistakes or errors.
    Outlier = rare but real data point that stands out.
    Imbalance dataset = some features  value more the other.
    Metrics 
        classification=Accuracy
        regression=mean^2 error
        clustering = derms index
        Ensemble learning= joining different ML model to make powerful model
        fNo of axis = Rank=No of dimension
        Vectorization= changing the text into number in terms of NLP

What is tensor?
    tensor is just simply a data structure
why tensor?
    => most of the library uses tensor as there data structure.used of ML and DL. TensorFlow used in deep learning which uses tensor as data structure
    
    Tensor is container in which we store number.

Tensor Example
    1D Tensor -> a Student list [cpga,rank}
    2D Tensor -> Two student list
    3D Tensor   -> stock price of days for a year => 2d and of 10 years is 3d
    4D tensor -> Images( RGB is 3D  tensor ) 50 RGB photo is 4D tensor
    5D tensor-> Videos( 60 sec*30fps,3,480,720) 5 video
