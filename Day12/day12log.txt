6th Video
Transforming
from this video i learned :-
    LLM are very good in transforming one input to different format . 
    like if you write something in nepali LLM can translate that into very different languages . 

    OR like change HTML TO JSON
    
    we can make a universal languages translator like multi languages into english using for loop like in dictonary of different lanaguauge

    we can manipulate language like a Formal or Informal and others

    we can use the model to correct grammeratical error alsoo.
     
    Proofread is the most used one.
    
    7th video 
    Expanding
    from this video i learned :-
        how we can generate personalized email based on the some reference
        
        Input parameter :-
            Temperature:- range between 0 to 1 (0 being the safest and 1 being the wildest) 

            If we are building a realiable application then it is good to used temperaute 0 as here is no randomness strictly what is best

            if we are building a creative  application then the temp can be above 0.5 or above

    juypter notebook panel 
    Panel is a Python library for building interactive dashboards and GUIs especially great for data apps, visualizations, and even chat interfaces right inside a Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab, or in a browser.
    panel code
 '"""
         import panel as pn
pn.extension()

slider = pn.widgets.IntSlider(name='Value', start=0, end=100)

@pn.depends(slider)
def output(value):
    return f"You selected: {value}"

dashboard = pn.Column(slider, output)
dashboard

    8th video
        building a chatbot  using chatgpt

        first we define the structure of the message system
            context=[
                {
                'role':'system'
                'content':""" description( give knowledge to chatgpt for reference "
                }
            ]


            using these context i can learned to create the chatbot for myself 

summary of the course 
    principles:_
        write clear and specific instructions
        give the model time to "think"
        iterative prompt development
        capabilites :summarzing, iferring, transforming, expanding
        building chat bot
