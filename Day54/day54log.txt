LSPP Day 54

Today i learned:-

Tool Binding:-

Tool Binding is the step where you register tools with a language model(LLM ) so that 
1. The LLM knows what tools are available
2.It knows what each tool does (via description)
3.It knows what input format to use(via schema)

Tool Calling

Tool calling is the process where the LLM decides, during a conversation or task,
 that it needs to use a specific tool and generates a structured output with 
    the name of the tool
    and the arguments to call it with 
The LLM does not actually run the tool - it just suggests the tool and the input arguments . 
The actual execution is handled by langchain or you.

Tool Execution

Tool Execution is the step where the actual python function is run using the input arguments that
 the LLM suggested during tool calling
in Simpler words:
    The LLM Says 
        Hey call the multiply with a>b and b=7
    Tool Execution is when you or langchain actually run
        and get the result
