LSPP Day 53

Today i learned:

What is a tool?
A tool is just a python function that is packaged in a way the LLM can understand and call when needed

LLMs  are great at:
    Reasoning
    Language generation
But they can't do things like
    Access live data 
    Do reliable math
    call APIs
    Run code
    Interact with a database

Type of tools
    Built in tools
    Custom tools
 
 How tools fits into the agent ecosystem
   An AI agent is an LLM powered system that can autonomously think, decide and take actions
    using external tools or APIs to achieve a goal.

Built in Tools

    a built in tool is a tool that langchain already provides for you its pre built , 
    production ready and requires minimal or no setup

    You don't have to write the function logic yourself - you just import and use it.

custom Tools
    A custom tool is a tool that you define yourself

        use them when:
            You want to  call your own APIs
            You want to ecapsulate business logic
            You want the LLM to interact with your database product or app.

        Ways to create custom tools
            1. using @tool decorator
            2. using structuredTool 
                A structured tool in langchain is a special type of tool where the input to the tool
                 follows a structured schema, typically defined using a pydantic model.
            3. Using BaseTool class
                    BaseTool is  the abstract base class for all tools in langchain . it defines the core 
                    structure and interface that any tool must follow whether it's simple one liner or a fully customized 
                    function . 

All other tool types like @tool , StructuredTool are built on top of BaseTool

 A toolkit is just a collection or related tools that serve a common purpose packaged together for conveniece and reusability
