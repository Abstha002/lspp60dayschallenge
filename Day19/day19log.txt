LSPP Day 19

Today i created the small project
    firstly, i used numpy,panda and synethics dataset

I used logistic regression(classification algorithm)
    draw the line and on the basis of that line it is used.
Steps that i followed are
    0.preprocess+EDA+Features selction
           for Preprocessing-> df.iloc for removing was used
           for EDA -> used matplot lib
    1.Extract input and output cols
            used iloc for these
    2.Scale the values
             for this i used scalar.transform()
    3.Train test split
            for this i used sklearn train_test_split
    4.Train the model
                .fit()
    5.Evaluate the model/model selection
            accuracy checking garyooo
    6.Deploy the model
            pickle import and then 
            pickle.dump( clf,open('modelname.pkl',"wb")) wb-> write binary mode
