What is MCP Server?
    An MCP server, when developed by Claude AI/Anthropic, refers to a component implementing the
    Model Context Protocol (MCP) — an open, standard way for AI assistants like Claude or Claude Code to 
    connect to external tools, data sources, or environments 

What is an MCP Server?
    Server Role

    Acts as a bridge exposing tools, files, APIs, or resources to an AI model.

    For example, a "filesystem" MCP server lets Claude read/write files; a "weather" server might fetch forecasts 

How It Works

    The AI client (e.g. Claude Desktop, Claude Code) calls serve to launch an MCP server process.

    That process implements the MCP specification (JSON-RPC 2.0), offering endpoints for actions like tool use, data retrieval, 
    or prompting 


Capabilities

    Servers can expose three categories: Resources (e.g. files, database records), Tools (functions like get-forecast), and Prompts (predefined templates) 

Typical Use Cases for a Claude‑AI MCP Server
        Local file manipulation
        via Filesystem MCP Server — Claude can list directories, open/edit files, automate coding tasks 


        Domain-specific integrations
        e.g. weather data, GitHub, Slack, Notion — adding real-time capabilities into conversation, code review, automation 


        Custom tool development
        Developers can build servers that let Claude interact with internal tools or proprietary 
        APIs using any supported SDK (Python, TypeScript, Java, Rust, etc.) 



Features

    Edit code files

MCP (Model context protocol) is the standard ,protocol 
    Model => AI model => Text, Images, Video ( GPT, Gemini, claude)
    Context=> Most important = what is the context
            What to give context
                => Tools ( function)
                => Resources: mostly attachments (csv files)
                => Sampling Way to query other model 
                => Prompts : Templates for clients 
    Protocol: Sets of rules - standards
            => reflection requestion ( how to talk with the server)

what is Vector database?
Vector database aka Vector store.
A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of data — commonly used in AI, machine learning, and semantic search.

What Are Vectors in This Context?
In AI and NLP, data like text, images, or audio is converted into vector embeddings — numerical representations in multi-dimensional space. For example:

A sentence like “I love Nepal” becomes a 768-dimensional vector: [0.12, -0.03, ..., 0.44].

These vectors can then be compared for similarity using metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

 What Is a Vector Database?
A vector database stores these embeddings and lets you:

Insert: Upload vectors with optional metadata (like original text, IDs, etc.)
Search: Find the most similar vectors using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
Update/Delete: Modify or remove stored vectors

Pg vector, pine cone, chroma

Flow 
    Take Question and convert to embedding
    find most relative embedding in db
    Question + relative chunk -> chatgpt
