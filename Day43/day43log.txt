What is MCP Server?

Features
    Search internet
    Edit code files

MCP (Model context protocol) is the standard ,protocol 
    Model => AI model => Text, Images, Video ( GPT, Gemini, claude)
    Context=> Most important = what is the context
            What to give context
                => Tools ( function)
                => Resources: mostly attachments (csv files)
                => Sampling Way to query other model 
                => Prompts : Templates for clients 
    Protocol: Sets of rules - standards
            => reflection requestion ( how to talk with the server)

Steps by steps procedure

    Client (stateful)
        server sent events <=> application(mongodb)
        Message endpoint


what is Vector database?
Vector database aka Vector store.
A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of data — commonly used in AI, machine learning, and semantic search.

What Are Vectors in This Context?
In AI and NLP, data like text, images, or audio is converted into vector embeddings — numerical representations in multi-dimensional space. For example:

A sentence like “I love Nepal” becomes a 768-dimensional vector: [0.12, -0.03, ..., 0.44].

These vectors can then be compared for similarity using metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

 What Is a Vector Database?
A vector database stores these embeddings and lets you:

Insert: Upload vectors with optional metadata (like original text, IDs, etc.)
Search: Find the most similar vectors using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
Update/Delete: Modify or remove stored vectors

Pg vector, pine cone, chroma

Flow 
    Take Question and convert to embedding
    find most relative embedding in db
    Question + relative chunk -> chatgpt
