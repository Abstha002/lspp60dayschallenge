LSPP Day 17

Today i learned 
=> what is the amount of supervision needed to train ML model
    Types of ML
        Based on amount of unsupervision needed
            =>Supervised
                    ->regression
                            ->we are doing some calculation and the model predict the value in numerical data then 
                            it is called as regression
                    ->classification
                            ->same as regression only thing being is the output is a categorical data
            =>Unsupervised
                    ->clustering
                        ->divide tuples on the basis of features (N dimension)
                    ->Dimensnality reduction
                        ->It will remove some dimension features that are not necessary adding value and merge them into
                         single dimension (feature exaction.-> why because we created new feature)(PCA)
                        MNIST(later checking left for visualization)
                    ->Anamonly Detection
                            ->finding who does fit in the group (outlier)
                    ->Association rule learning 
                            ->it is like what association with each other( people who buys milk buys bread)
                             
            =>Semi-supervised
                    -> it is partially unsupervised and partially supervised 
                        so this is like input is feed to the system system classify or clustering those but
                         without the label , to label these unlabel data supervision is need so it it like that

            =>Reinforcement
                    ->Human like learning. NO data is given it start from scratch and build up the knowledge base(Reward or punishment) 
                        steps
                            1. observe
                            2.select action using policy
                            3.action
                            4.get rewards
                            5.update policy(learning)
                            6.iterate 

Types of data (generally)
    => Numerical Data
        ->age 
        ->weight
        ->cgpa

    =>Categorical Data
        ->gender
        ->nationality

what is production 
        => production is basically server on which the "ml model " is hosted on.
Types of ML on the basis of production
    Types
        =>Batch machine learnig
                ->In batch training whole dataset is trained at once.usually do in offline mode. once the model is trained you load the trained model
                ->The model is totally static.
                Drawback( model is must be retrained periodically,Lots of data,hardware limitation,availability)
        =>Online machine learning
                ->Online learning is done incrementally .it is given a small batch (small chuck of data ) it can be done in server itself.
                Eg:- chatbots
                

        What to use what
            1.Where there is concept drift?
                =>if the nature of problem changes online learning is better
            2.Cost Effective?
                =>online learning is cost effective as small chuck is trained as batch learning
            3.Faster solution 
                => online learning is faster
            
    
        how to implement
            linear regression algorithm(linear_model)
            SGDRegressor for online learning(offers fit and partial_fit
            => River (python library for online machine learning)
            =>vowpal wabbit( used for RL, as well as online learning)
        
        Learning Rate 
            => how frequently data is trained

        Out of core learning 
            =>data is so huge you can't load into memory so here its better to use online learning. so divide into parts and train
        
        Cons of online learning 
            Tricky to use
                output is not sure and safe
            Risky
                No constraints of data and if not handle properly it would be trained on wrong data leads of failure of model

                Types of machine learning on the basis of learning
               => Instance Based Learning Model
                    -> this is based on learning by memorizing like storing everything
                        no concept of training or learning
                    (KNN,kernel function, rbf)
               =>Model based learning Model
                    -> this is based on learning by pattern 
                    -> its like it creates boundaries to differentiate rather than previos data points
                        (Decisiontree..)

                    instance based in also known as lazy learner (during model does nothing)
