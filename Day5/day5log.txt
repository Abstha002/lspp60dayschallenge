LSPP Day 5
 
Today i learned the following :-

Data Science (Overview)
    => Data science is all about mathematics
    From a bird i view Data science is all about mathematics concept

    Data science is all about making data work for you  meaning collect all data from source and generate an perfect 
    or needed conclusion from certain operation

    Every thing you do and see in the internet is all about data. 


    Data science 
        AWS bills , Employee cost 
        finding major point like D-Dos attack Fraud dectation and all is data science

        "Predict Future" (eg:- predicting future)

        From my point of view why data science is popularity it is because as mathematical models are in computerized
         form it is easy for the calculations so it has gained massive popularitys

Steps in Data science
    1. Collect Data + Store Data 
    2.Data preparation( Cleaning , missing data formats ) 
    3.Visualization & Exploration(Dashboards comparissions)
    4.Predictions and experiments(ab testing , forecast )


Starting Numpy
    [1,2,3,4,5,6] =>vector or array
    [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] =>Matrix

    When it is difficult to call any N-dimension matrix it is called as tensor

    Found out matrices that whole machine learning foundation is based in matrices.

    Found out Numpy is totally built in c++.and Python is just a layer above  cpp

  pytorch => deep learning library (trains models and all)

  Numpy code
   in python it is called list but numpy  it is called numpy array 
found out numpy array is way fast than normal list
   method of numpy
    ->np.array([]) => generate array
      fancy word for number scalar
    ->np.arange()=> this gives the range of the numbers
    ->np.zeros((3,4))=> generate matrix with 3*4 
    ->np.ones((dim))=>1 matrix
    ->np.full(dim,value)=> dimension with constant value
    ->np.random
        ->np.random.random((dim))
        ->np.arange(0,10,steps(2))
