LSPP Day 9

Today i learned and explored the parts of the machine learning in the way of pandas. Starting with 
    what is pandas
        pandas is a python library that help you work with data in tables, could like data in spreadsheets , csv, datasets 
         it is used for doing maths queries like counts  average and all
        it is also used for flitering data 
        with the help of previous library like matplotlib with can do data visuallization also 
        
        Dataframe in pandas is like a table of data with rows and columns. 
        columns => data => attributes like numbers, text or dates
        rows => record => tuple 
        basically it is smart table that help you to filter, sort or calculate , and save to the file also.
        

        And Series is the subset of the data table like a single column of data with label for each value. Data table is name of bunch of series 
        for eg:-  there is student data table and then the name of the is series

        series gives a output as 1D labeled array.

        pd.DataFrame(data, index=None, columns=None, dtype=None, copy=None)

        Here .Dataframe is used to create the dataframe 

    df=pd.DataFrame(data)
        df.head()=> gives the first few rows of array
        df.intof()=> summary
        df.describe()=> gives all the numeric output like (avg,means ,meds) and all
        df['col name']=[]=> this adds the column name another new one

        we have filter also df[df['age']>20])

        this filter out the value

        for indexing and slicing 
            we have df.iloc[0]=> this gives the first row 
                            df.iloc[0:2]=slices out the other rows and give only  0 to 2 rows

                            df.sort_values(by='column name')
                                => this sorts out the values 
                                 asceding and desceding in garna milxa hai using asceding=false

                            df.grouby('column name') method can also be applied like .mean() and others

 Handlig missing values
                                df.isnull()=>check if the value is null or not
                                df.dropna()=> check and drops the row with the missing value
                                df.fillna()


    loading and reading the csv values
        => pd.read_csv('file name')
