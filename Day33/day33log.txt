Today i learned
what is using pre trained model?

A model which is train in already in another data

what is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is a  machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused for a different but related task.Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be computationally expensive and require large datasets , transfer learing leverage knowledge from a pre- trained model to imporove learining efficeincey and performance.

uses pre trained model

How transfer learning works?
1.Pretraining on a large dataset.
2.Fine tuning for an New task.

It works like convolution and pooling layer works are pre trained and the parameter are freeze( there will be no changes in the value ) and the model last layer will only be trained in the small dataset.

Eg( Pre trained model part is trained on the basic features like edges and shapes, so adding our different dataset help model to predict wheather it is a shirt or pant)




Flaws of Deep learning

1.Deep learning model are data hunger
2.Training deep learning model is costly

Steps that i took 
    1. Import 
    2.detach classifier
    3.attach classifier (custom that we build)
    4.freeze fe(feature extraction) layer
    5.Train

What is Convolution (in CNN)?
Convolution is a mathematical operation where a small filter (kernel) slides over an input (like an image) and computes weighted sums to extract features.

In simple terms:
Convolution means scanning a small window (e.g., 3×3) over the image to detect patterns like edges, lines, or textures.

Example (for image):
You slide a 3×3 filter over the image.
At each step, multiply the filter with the image patch, sum the values.
The result forms a feature map.

In CNNs:
Helps the model learn spatial patterns in data.
Each convolutional layer extracts higher-level features.

what is vgg16?
    VGG16 is a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford.

Key Facts:
    16 layers deep (13 convolutional + 3 fully connected layers).
    Trained on ImageNet dataset — 1.4 million images, 1,000 classes.
    Input images are PIL images resized to 224×224.
    Commonly used for image classification, feature extraction, and transfer learning.

What is torchvision?
    Torchvision is a PyTorch library that provides tools for computer vision tasks.
