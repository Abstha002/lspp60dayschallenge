Streamlit
    Streamlit is an open-source Python library used to create simple web apps for data science and machine learning.
It lets you build interactive dashboards with very little code.
You can display charts, tables, text, and user inputs easily.
Just run your Python script, and Streamlit turns it into a web app.
It's great for sharing data insights quickly.

What the difference between fastApi and Streamlit
    FastAPI is used to build backend APIs â€” it helps you create web services that handle requests and return data, usually in JSON.
    Streamlit is for building interactive front-end apps â€” mainly used in data science to show results visually.
    FastAPI focuses on speed, performance, and serving data.
    Streamlit focuses on simplicity, visuals, and user interaction.
    You can use both together: FastAPI for data logic, Streamlit for UI.

About streamlit
    Streamlit is not just a UI library.
    It can handle both UI (front end) and backend logic in the same Python script.

Some method most used in Streamlit are :-
Text and Output
st.write() â€“ Displays text, variables, dataframes, etc.
st.text() â€“ Shows plain text.
st.markdown() â€“ Renders text using Markdown formatting.
st.code() â€“ Displays code with syntax highlighting.

Data Display
st.dataframe() â€“ Displays interactive tables (sortable, scrollable).
st.table() â€“ Shows static tables.
st.line_chart(), st.bar_chart(), st.area_chart() â€“ Built-in charts for quick plotting.

User Input Widgets
st.button() â€“ Adds a clickable button.
st.slider() â€“ Adds a slider to select a numeric value.
st.text_input() â€“ Gets user text input.
st.selectbox() â€“ Dropdown menu for selecting from a list.
st.checkbox() â€“ Checkbox input.
st.radio() â€“ Radio buttons for selecting one option.

 File Handling
st.file_uploader() â€“ Lets users upload files.
