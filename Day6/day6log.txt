  LSPP Day 6
 
 Today i learned this following things :-
    -> array.shape:-gives rows and column 
        array.ndim:- gives in dimension
        array.size:-total number of element in the array 
        array.dtype:- gives Data type


        Array reshaping
          array.reshape(dimension)=> this reshaped this array in prefered dimension
          array.flatten()=> this flattend the array
          array.ravel()=> this give the original array ,You want performance, no copy unless needed

          Index and slicing
          Slicing basic in python 
                  array[index:index]
                  array[index:index:steps]
                  array[-2]
              arr_2d
                accessing arr_2d 
                  arr_2d[1]=> this gives row 1 of the matrix

                np.sort(unsorted) => this takes unsorted as input and sorts it
                np.sort[arr-2d_unsorted, axis=1) 0 is column 1 is row

                filtering array
                number[numbers%2==0]
                  we can write expession inside in this [] using numpy
                  in mask we can store whole expression for the evalution like
                    mask=number>5
                    then it will be like numbers[mask] this is give by numpy found this so so useful
